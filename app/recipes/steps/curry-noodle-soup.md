1. Chop and saute
   1. Roughly cut the onion & chuck it in the thing
   2. Put the chillies in if you're adding them
   3. A dash of oil
   4. Pepper
   5. I wouldn't bother adding salt/MSG, there's usually enough in the curry sauce
   6. A little dry thyme
2. Chunky cook
   1. Add chicken (raw is fine), cut into thinish strips
   2. Add 4 servings of the curry stuff.
   3. Add carrot, cut into thin circles.
   4. Fill with boiling water to the hot-max line
3. 6 mins from the end, add the noodles.
4. A quick pulse or two once it's done, if the noodles need broken up a bit
