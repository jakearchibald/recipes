1. **Rub chicken** in cajun seasoning
2. **Sear the Chicken:** Heat olive oil and butter in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Season chicken with pepper, then fry until golden and cooked through (about 5–6 minutes). Remove from the pan and set aside.
3. **Sauté the Veg:** In the same pan, cook the onion for 2 minutes. Add the mushrooms, garlic, and chillies, sautéing until the mushrooms are soft and browned (approx. 6 minutes).
4. **Build the Sauce:** Stir in the mustard powder and pour in the 100ml chicken stock (and wine, if using). Let it simmer for 3 minutes. Reduce the heat and stir in the cream & MSG, letting it bubble gently for 5 minutes until thickened. Maybe add more cajun.
5. **Cook the Pasta:** While the sauce simmers, boil the pasta in salted water according to the standard instructions until al dente. Reserve a splash of the starchy pasta water before draining.
6. **Combine:** Toss the cooked pasta and chicken into the sauce. If it's too thick, add a little of the reserved pasta water. Season to taste.
7. Serve with sprinkle of parmesan
